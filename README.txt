This is the development repository for DLTdv and friends. 

See https://biomech.web.unc.edu/dltdv/ for stable versions, sample data and so on.

Current development by Ty Hedrick is focused on DLTdv7, which works on the latest versions of MATLAB,
introduces many new features and also restores the multi-track capability that was discontinued in 
DLTdv6. Users with modern MATLAB installations should use DLTdv7, and it should be a seamless migration
for users currently running DLTdv6.
